The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million, the second-highest in India after Mumbai, while the whole NCT's population was about 16.8 million. Delhi's urban area is now considered to extend beyond the NCT boundaries, and include the neighbouring satellite cities of Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in an area called the National Capital Region (NCR) and had an estimated 2016 population of over 26 million people, making it the world's second-largest urban area according to the United Nations. Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Delhi either the **most or second-most productive metro area of India**. Delhi is the **second-wealthiest city in India after Mumbai and is home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires**.Delhi ranks **fifth**among the Indian states and union territories in human development index.Delhi has the second-highest GDP per capita in India. Delhi is of great historical significance as an important commercial, transport, and cultural hub, as well as the political centre of India."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In recent years, a vast number of people have migrated to Delhi.
